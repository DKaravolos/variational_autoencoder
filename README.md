# variational_autoencoder
A variational autoencoder class in Keras 2.0 with an MNIST example.

I created this class based on the Keras example because I found that adapting the example to my data, including adding more layers, was a bit tedious.

Containing the code for the model in a class results in a more plug&play experience when you just want to try something fast without digging through code. 

This repo includes an adapted version of the VAE example for MNIST, so you can see the usage. I adapted as little from this example as possible for easy comparison.
The original example can be found here: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/variational_autoencoder.py
